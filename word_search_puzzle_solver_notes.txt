
Word Search Solver Personal Notes

- When taking in the letters itself from the input file, we need make sure uppercase and lowercase are representing the same letter. We should make a separate function for this. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to work with default lowercase, i.e. uppercase -> uppercase and lowercase -> uppercase.

Note: Palindrome words will show up twice!

- Create a print_board function, similar to the function in minesweeper

- I need to figure out a way to take in a board using a .txt file. I don't know how I should do this.
-- Solution: first specify width and height of the board (Minimum width, height = 2). And then input the board. Something like this:

8 5
j s i p s s a k
p j s ...
k ...
p ...
l ...

^^ Something like this


Also, I should sort the word bank in alphabetical order
Maybe: I should also report the results in alphabetical order using a map
map<string, int> string = word. int = number of times found.
