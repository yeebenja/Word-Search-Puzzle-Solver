After "word_search_puzzle_solver.cpp" compiling, command line arguments must be included. Following the executable, the board .txt file and word bank .txt file are passed into main. In this example, "[executable] chinese_new_year_board.txt chinese_new_year_word_bank.txt" was called.

In the board .txt file, the width and height of the word search board must be specified above the board text. In this example, the word search puzzle was 15 by 15.

Lowercase and uppercase letters do not cause an issue inside both input files, although, results will print found words in uppercase letters for readability, as seen above.
